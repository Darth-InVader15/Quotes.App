# Quotes for You

My first Flutter project was created to provide inspirational quotes without the annoyance of endless ads, a common feature in many motivational apps on the Play Store.

## UI Design
The UI is best suited for devices with OLED displays, and its color scheme draws inspiration from the classic XDA website (of the 2016 era).

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
